# PS5 Kernel Module Loader - Development Progress

## Overview

This document summarizes the work done to build a working kernel module loader (`kldload.elf`) for PS5 firmware 4.03. The loader receives arbitrary kernel code over a TCP socket, copies it into executable kernel memory, and launches it as a kernel thread via `kproc_create`. Starting from a pre-built `kstuff.elf` baseline, we hit a series of kernel panics and hangs that required deep debugging of the kekcall infrastructure, memory allocation, page table permissions, and kernel function calling conventions.

**Final result**: The loader is fully functional. A test payload (`test_kmod.bin`) confirmed end-to-end execution by writing `0xCAFEBABE`/`0xDEAD` markers from kernel context.

---

## Architecture

The system has three layers:

1. **ps5-kstuff-ldr** (loader) - ELF loader that mmaps the kstuff payload at a fixed address (`0x0000000926100000`), parses ELF headers, and calls `entry()`. After entry returns, it patches `app.db` via SQLite.

2. **ps5-kstuff** (main payload) - Initializes r0gdb, hooks `getpid` syscall for kekcall dispatch, sets up per-CPU kelf/uelf trap handlers, patches kernel security flags, IDT entries, and exports function pointers (`r0gdb_kmalloc`, `r0gdb_kfncall`, etc.) via an `r0_table` parameter.

3. **uelf** (micro-ELF trap handler) - Intercepts `#DB` and `#GP` exceptions in kernel context. Routes `getppid` syscalls to `handle_kekcall()` which dispatches based on kekcall number. All kernel function calls use `push_stack`/`doreti_iret`/`MKTRAP` trap patterns for safe return frames.

### Kekcall Table (Final State)

| Nr | Function | Description |
|----|----------|-------------|
| 1 | copyout | Copy kernel memory to userspace |
| 2 | copyin | Copy userspace memory to kernel |
| 6 | malloc | Allocate kernel heap memory |
| 7 | kproc_create | Launch a kernel thread |
| 8 | copyin (kernel context) | Full kernel copyin via push_stack/trap |
| 9 | Diagnostics | Read proc info, kernel memory |
| 10 | NX bit clearing | Walk page tables, clear NX on PTEs |
| 0xffffffff | Liveness check | Returns 0 if kstuff is loaded |

## Kernel Panics and Fixes (Chronological)

### Panic 1: Payload Not Executing (Uninitialized r0_table)

**Symptom**: `kstuff.elf` loaded without errors but did nothing. No kernel patches applied, no kekcall handlers registered.

**Root cause**: The loader's `hacky_args` buffer was not zeroed. The 7th parameter (`r0_table`) picked up garbage from the stack, which was non-NULL. The payload checks `if (r0_table != NULL)` to decide whether to export function pointers and return early (kldload mode) vs. do full initialization. With garbage in `r0_table`, it always returned early.

**Fix** (`4c986ff`): `memset(hacky_args, 0, 0x200)` before calling `entry()`.

---

### Panic 2: die() on Missing uelf Log Symbols

**Symptom**: Payload hit `die()` at line 196/197 during `load_kelf`.

**Root cause**: The loader's symbol table didn't include `uelf_log_buffer_kptr`, `uelf_log_buffer_size`, and `uelf_log_buffer_pos_kptr`. The kelf loader expected these symbols and called `die()` when they weren't found.

**Fix** (`dd79105`): Added the three uelf log buffer symbols to the loader's symbol export table.

---

### Panic 3: kekcall nr=6 (malloc) Returning 0

**Symptom**: `kmem_alloc` via kekcall always returned 0 to userspace, even though kernel malloc succeeded internally.

**Root cause**: The nr=6 handler used `TRAP_UTILS` which didn't store malloc's RAX return value into `td_retval`. The kernel syscall return path interpreted the pointer in RAX as an error code and zeroed the userspace return value.

**Fix** (`19fc9ab`): Changed to `TRAP_KEKCALL,5` with a custom handler that saves RAX into `td_retval[0]` and sets RAX=0 (success).

**Complication**: Rebuilding the full payload from source produced different machine code that hung on PS5. Solution (`4667456`): binary-patched only the uelf portion into the original working payload, fitting the new 21,768-byte uelf exactly into the original slot.

---

### Panic 4: kproc_create NULL fmt Dereference

**Symptom**: Immediate kernel panic when calling `kproc_create` via kekcall nr=7.

**Root cause**: `kproc_create(func, arg, procptr, 0, 0, fmt)` expects the process name string in R9 (the `fmt` parameter). The kekcall handler passed `kproc_name` on the stack as a variadic argument instead of in R9. This left R9=NULL, and `vsnrprintf` dereferenced NULL, causing an immediate page fault in kernel context.

**Fix** (`bc47ee5`): Passed `kproc_name` as R9 directly instead of as a stack argument.

---

### Panic 5: kproc_create Missing Return Frame

**Symptom**: Kernel panic after `kproc_create` returned. The function itself executed successfully (thread was created), but the return crashed.

**Root cause**: The kekcall nr=7 handler didn't set up a proper `doreti_iret` + `MKTRAP` return frame. When `kproc_create` executed `ret`, it popped garbage from the stack and jumped to an invalid address.

**Intermediate workaround** (`bbaac11`): Bypassed kekcall nr=7 entirely, using `r0gdb_kfncall` to call `kproc_create` directly at its kernel address with a FW-version offset lookup table.

**Proper fix** (`5eb9af9`): Added `doreti_iret + MKTRAP(TRAP_KEKCALL, 6)` return frame and corresponding trap handler 6. This matched the pattern already used by kekcall nr=6 (malloc).

---

### Panic 6: copyin Failing on Kernel Heap Addresses

**Symptom**: `kernel_copyin` (SDK function) returned -1 when copying to malloc'd kernel addresses. Code was never actually written to kernel memory.

**Root cause**: The SDK's `kernel_copyin` uses DMAP (direct physical memory mapping) to translate addresses. Malloc'd kernel heap addresses (`0xffffff80...`) aren't in the DMAP range and can't be resolved this way.

**Attempts**:
- (`9172b74`) Added kekcall nr=8 calling kernel's own `copyin()` directly
- (`0739180`) Tried DMEM-based copyin (translate both user and kernel VA to physical, memcpy through DMEM)
- (`cf1b093`) Fixed user VA resolution -- kernel CR3 doesn't map user addresses due to KPTI, needed process-specific CR3

**Final fix** (`ec59e43`): Used `push_stack`/`doreti_iret`/`MKTRAP(TRAP_KEKCALL, 7)` to call kernel's `copyin()` in full kernel context with proper CR3. This handles both user VA and kernel VA correctly.

---

### Panic 7: NX Bit on Malloc'd Pages

**Symptom**: Kernel thread created successfully but crashed immediately on first instruction. The copied code was correct in memory but not executable.

**Root cause**: `malloc` returns pages with the NX (No-Execute) bit set (bit 63 of the PTE). The kernel thread's instruction fetch triggered a page fault because the page was marked non-executable.

**Attempts**:
- (`77e4639`) Switched to `kmem_alloc(kernel_vmmap, size)` for RWX memory
- (`f86ee80`) Used `kmem_alloc` with `kmem_alloc_rwx_fix` breakpoint to change protection to `VM_PROT_ALL=7`
- (`8e62082`) Discovered that the `malloc_arena_fix` debug breakpoint (DR0) caused `kmem_alloc` to hang in an infinite retry loop

**Final fix** (`aa53367`, `8120daf`): Reverted to `malloc` (which works reliably) and added **kekcall nr=10** that walks kernel page tables via DMEM, clears the NX bit (bit 63) on PTEs, and flushes TLB. Applied after `copyin` completes but before `kproc_create` launches the thread.

---

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Binary patching vs. source rebuilding**: Rebuilding the full payload from source often produced different machine code that hung or crashed. Binary-patching only the changed uelf portion into the original working payload was the reliable approach.

2. **Return frames are mandatory**: Every kernel function call from a kekcall handler requires a `push_stack` with `doreti_iret + MKTRAP` return frame. Without this, the called function's `ret` pops garbage and panics. This was the root cause of multiple panics.

3. **KPTI complicates everything**: The kernel's CR3 is KPTI-limited and cannot resolve user addresses or certain kernel heap addresses. Calling kernel functions that touch user memory requires full kernel context with the process-specific CR3.

4. **Memory allocation strategy**: `malloc` is reliable but returns NX pages. `kmem_alloc` can provide RWX pages but conflicts with debug register breakpoints. Final approach: `malloc` + manual NX bit clearing via page table walks through DMEM.

5. **Debug register conflicts**: The `malloc_arena_fix` breakpoint (DR0) interfered with `kmem_alloc`, causing infinite retry loops. Hardware debug registers are a limited resource and breakpoint conflicts can cause subtle hangs.

## Current Status

The kernel module loader (`kldload.elf`) is **fully functional**:

- Receives kernel code over TCP (port 9022)
- Allocates kernel heap memory via `malloc` (kekcall nr=6)
- Copies code into kernel memory via kernel `copyin` (kekcall nr=8)
- Clears NX bit on code pages via page table walk (kekcall nr=10)
- Launches kernel thread via `kproc_create` (kekcall nr=7)
- Verified with `test_kmod.bin` writing `0xCAFEBABE`/`0xDEAD` markers

The `apic_ops.bin` research payload (2816 bytes) loads and launches without panic. Its output goes to `kprintf` (kernel log buffer) rather than back over the network, so results must be read from the kernel log.
